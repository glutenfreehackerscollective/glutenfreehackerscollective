# About the Gluten Free Hackers Collective
----

The Gluten Free Hackers Collective started with a post in the DEF CON subreddit about trying to build a group of gluten free hackers. It grew to crowd sourcing food recommendations, finding safe places to eat, and meeting up to share the food with everyone. 

Once the group had some traction (a handful of successful meetups and one mildly successful run at a CTF) we took a vote, and after Hacker Summer Camp 2025 the group decided to rebrand from "Gluten Free DC" to the "Gluten Free Hackers Collective" to be more inclusive of other conferences. Check out our [discord](https://discord.gg/4AyQuszjf6) and join the fun with other Gluten Free hackers around the country.
