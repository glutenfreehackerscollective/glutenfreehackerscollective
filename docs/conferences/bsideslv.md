# BSides Las Vegas
[BSides Las Vegas](https://bsideslv.org/) (BSidesLV) is a 2.5 day security conference hosted at the Tuscany Suites & Casino in Las Vegas, NV. The conference typically happens early August, in the days leading up to DEF CON. 

From the [BSidesLV About page](https://bsideslv.org/about):

> What started in 2009 as several conversations on Twitter about the politics of InfoSec conferences and the disappointing CFP rejections turned into a plan to host a small alternative event to create a friendlier space and really put the focus on the conversations that make our community great. What started in a vacation rental grew into larger and larger spaces before making our home at Tuscany Suites and Casino.

BSidesLV was the first event of the BSides family and is amongst the largest BSides events around the world. In recent years, BSidesLV has also partnered with Skytalks to bring the off the record track to the BSidesLV venue. 

Volunteers are who make most conferences in the security space run, and BSidesLV is no exception. If you are interested in joining the team, keep an eye on the BSidesLV website and sign up for the Call for Volunteers (CFV) when it is live.

## BSidesLV Events
BSidesLV hosts several special events during the conference including:
- BSides Organizers Meetup
- Queercon Mixer
- The BSidesLV Pool Party
- BSidesLV Pub Quiz & Karaoke

## Gluten Free Food at BSidesLV
BSidesLV provides meals to certain attendees, volunteers, and staff during the conference. These meals are prepared by the Tuscany kitchens, and in recent years, have been marked with allergen contents. 

Additionally, [Firefly](https://www.fireflylv.com/) is about a quarter mile from the Tuscany, and has fantastic allergen protocols including separate kitchen space and staff training.
Firefly* has two locations, the one closest to the Tuscany is located at 335 Hughes Center Dr, Las Vegas, NV.
