## Gluten Dude
The [Gluten Dude](https://glutendude.app/) restaurant finding app does require a subscription, however, all of the establishments in the app are screened by the Gluten Dude team to make sure that they are safe for dining. The app features a list and map of vetted restaurants, forums for app subscribers, a listing of GF locations at airports around the world. The [Gluten Dude](https://glutendude.com/) website also has a ton of other resources regarding celiac and gluten free. 

The app offers a 7 day free trial, after the trial expires you can purchase the app through the app store on a subscription basis, or wait until the lifetime pass is on sale and purchase it that way. Sale prices range from ~$50  to ~$100 USD for a lifetime pass depending on the sale.
