# Contributing to glutenfreehackerscollective/glutenfreehackerscollective
We created the GFHC to provide community to gluten free hackers everywhere, in that spirit we welcome all kinds of contributions to the site! If you have an event that you would like to add, recommendations for other GF hackers, or something else that you think should be documented in the wiki we welcome your changes.

To submit your changes to the GFHC wiki:
1. Fork, then clone your new repo
2. Make your changes
3. Ensure the site will build using Jekyll
4. Commit your changes with a clean commit message
5. Submit a pull request to the GFHC repo
   
Once your PR has been reviewed and approved by the @glutenfreehackerscollective/Dev, the changes will be merged into the parent repo.


## Building locally to test
Ensure that you have installed ruby and the jekyll and budler gems, then 
1. Install the bundler and jekyll gems `gem install bundler jekyll`
   - And dependencies if needed `bundle install`   
2. Start the local server `bundle exec jekyll serve` 
3. Validate that the site builds properly, and any changes you made to content work as expected.
